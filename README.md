## Scenario
Bellabeat, founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, is a high-tech company that focuses on manufacturing smart products for women. These products collect data on sleep, reproductive health, stress, and activity to empower women with knowledge about their own health. Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
